**DATA EXPLORATION USING SQL SERVER**

This project will go through an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 data using SQL Server. Link to dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

For practical purposes the data was divided in two datasets:

- CovidDeaths.xlsx
- CovidVaccinations.xlsx

SQL techniques to query different type of data, to mention some:

- Total cases vs total deaths.
- Highest death count in each country.
- Looking at total population vs total vaccinations using window function.
- Using CTE to create the rolling ratio of people vaccinated in a country.
- Create a view of People Vaccinated throughout time to visualize later.
